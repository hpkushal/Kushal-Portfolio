          <p>
            <strong>Resulta</strong> had been running marketing campaigns across multiple channels for several years, but was struggling with accurate performance measurement and optimization. As the company expanded its digital brand portfolio and increased marketing investments, the need for sophisticated attribution and optimization became critical.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the <strong>Digital Product Strategist</strong> with responsibility for growth initiatives, I identified that our marketing performance was significantly underperforming industry benchmarks. While we were generating leads and customers, the lack of proper attribution and optimization was resulting in inefficient budget allocation and missed revenue opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge was particularly acute because we were operating multiple brands with different customer journeys, attribution windows, and conversion patterns. Traditional marketing measurement approaches were inadequate for our complex multi-touch, multi-brand ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            With my background in <strong>50+ project deliveries</strong> and deep understanding of digital analytics, I recognized this as a strategic opportunity to implement advanced performance marketing frameworks that would drive significant improvements in marketing efficiency and revenue attribution.

      title: "The Problem",
      content: (
        <div>
          <p>
            Our marketing operations were suffering from fundamental measurement and optimization challenges that were limiting growth potential and wasting marketing budget:
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Poor Attribution Visibility</strong></p>
          <p>
            Only 35% of conversions were properly attributed to marketing channels, leaving the majority of revenue impact invisible. This created a massive blind spot in understanding which campaigns, channels, and audiences were actually driving results.
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Inefficient Budget Allocation</strong></p>
          <p>
            Without accurate attribution data, marketing budgets were allocated based on incomplete information. High-performing channels were under-funded while low-performing channels continued to receive budget, resulting in suboptimal ROI across the entire marketing portfolio.
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Limited Cross-Channel Optimization</strong></p>
          <p>
            Each marketing channel operated in isolation without understanding of cross-channel customer journeys. This siloed approach prevented optimization of the complete customer experience and missed opportunities for channel synergy.
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Manual Reporting and Analysis</strong></p>
          <p>
            Marketing performance analysis required 15-20 hours per week of manual data compilation from multiple platforms. This time-intensive process delayed optimization decisions and limited the frequency of campaign adjustments.
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Inconsistent Data Quality</strong></p>
          <p>
            Different platforms used varying attribution models, tracking implementations, and data definitions, making it impossible to create unified performance views. Data discrepancies undermined confidence in marketing decisions.
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Limited Optimization Velocity</strong></p>
          <p>
            Slow data processing and analysis cycles meant optimization decisions were made on outdated information. By the time performance issues were identified and addressed, significant budget had already been wasted.
