      <p>
        The creator economy has evolved from a collection of side hustles to a legitimate sector of the global 
        economy. What started with bloggers monetizing through advertising has transformed into a sophisticated 
        ecosystem of content creators, platforms, tools, and business models. But the era of easy growth is ending. 
        The creator economy is maturing, and with that maturation comes both new opportunities and new challenges. 
        This shift reflects broader patterns we see in <a href="/writings/platform-economics-unbundling-rebundling" style={{color: '#667eea', textDecoration: 'underline'}}>platform economics</a>, 
        where initial growth phases give way to more sustainable, professionalized business models.

        Today's successful creators aren't just content producers—they're entrepreneurs building diversified 
        media businesses. This professionalization is reshaping the entire industry, from how creators operate 
        to how platforms and brands engage with the creator economy.
